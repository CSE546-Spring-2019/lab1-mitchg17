In order to run the program, you must first comile count.c using the makefile. In order to do this, run the command 'make'.

Once you have done this, you can execute the program on an exisiting input file with the command 'count <inputFile> <searchTerm> <outputFile>'. A file will be created with the name provided for <outputFile> and it will contain the length in bytes of <inputFile> as well as the number of matches to <searchTerm> found in the input file.
